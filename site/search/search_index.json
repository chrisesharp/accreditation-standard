Background 1.1 Context The proposed standard must be: a. Fit for purpose for whole project especially themes 1, 2 and 3 b. Fit for all IoC partners c. Fit for broad industry d. Takes into account existing standards 1.2. Requirements An initial discussion in the online meeting on 9th April identified a number of requirements within the context above. Some overarching targets are givens: FHEQ (Framework for Higher Education Qualifications) outcomes statement equivalents for Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland? QAA (Quality Assurance Agency) subject benchmark statement (for degree apprenticeships) Institute for Apprentices (IfA) endorsement. The standard needs to specify both technical and \u201csoft\u201d skills. The focus should be on work readiness rather than employability Must meet the needs of, and be endorsed by, industry Should be able to recognise both industry-created and academic content. Should allow interoperability between HEIs and industry In particular, must support needs of SMEs Must be flexible Given that there will be several curricula, a core standard with extensions may be appropriate. The core might include such as coding, group work, lifecycle, soft skills. (For theme 2) \u2013 needs to support degree apprenticeships as well as degrees (L6 & L7). (for theme 3) \u2013 would be good if it were possible to specify chunks smaller than a complete degree \u2013 perhaps using some sort of \u201clayering\u201d or \u201ccomponent\u201d model. Should link to other accreditations e.g., BCS, IET Will be different from Tech Partnership Degrees (TPD) standards for degree apprenticeships. Industry involvement in the development and adoption of the standard is crucial. This will require ongoing involvement of individuals from a wide range of employers from across the sector, constituting a broadly-based industrial panel. 1.3. Constraints Development will require industrial participation in discussions and workshops. If the standard is to be used for Degree Apprenticeships (DAs), then it needs to address a distinct space from those standards already in operation, primarily those developed/under development by Tech Partnership and ONS. No standard is of value if it is neither accepted by the sector nor implementable. The eventual operation of the standard is outwith the discussion in this paper. The IoC is not (yet) authorised to accredit anything \u2013 at best, it might offer a \u201ckite mark\u201d endorsement. Only professional bodies, such as BCS are currently able to accredit against a standard. 1.4. Opportunities In developing the new standard, we could choose to work with existing accreditation bodies (BCS, TPD, GCHQ), and/or with other bodies such as SFIA who manage a user-defined skills framework for the sector. In order to distinguish the IoC standard from other standards, such as those managed by TPD, we might align it to professional qualifications, such as CITP, or CIISP. Early informal discussions with both BCS and SFIA indicate that they are willing \u2013 indeed, keen! \u2013 to collaborate with IoC 1.5. Discussion The separation of the standard from the curricula (workstreams 1.2, 1.3 and themes 2/3) mean that the standard itself needs to be very flexible and adaptable. This is best achieved by abstraction. There is a marked contrast between standards such as the BCS accreditation criteria and the TPD DA standards: the former has relatively few generic requirements that can be contextualised for a particular degree, whereas the latter is essentially a long conjunctive list of requirements. Indeed, in the latter, there is no application of MoSCow (must/should/could/won't) \u2013 all requirements and sub-requirements are given equal weight. One of the key requirements is that the standard must meet industry needs. Although foundational knowledge and principles are important, the key focus is to be on what [graduates] will be able to do. That is, it will focus on skills and outcomes, rather than on curriculum and inputs. And, crucially, the definition of skills and outputs needs to be recognised and accepted by industry. It may be appropriate for the standard to suggest \u201cstaged\u201d outputs \u2013 particularly in the context of degree apprenticeships \u2013 to ensure that those following a standard are \u201cbillable\u201d early in their studies.","title":"Background"},{"location":"standard/background/#1-background","text":"","title":"1.

This would allow the \u201coccupation\u201d for any degree apprenticeships to be \u201cIT professional\u201d, which is distinct from \u201cdigital and technology solutions professional\u201d (i.(c)). 3.1. SFIA 3.1.1. (content from SFIA website) SFIA 1 , the Skills Framework for the Information Age, describes skills required by professionals in roles involving information and communications technology. Since [its formal inception in] 2000, SFIA has become the de facto global IT skills Framework, used in nearly 200 countries by organisations and individuals to characterise and manage their skills. The SFIA Framework remains relevant and useful because it is simple and generic and is updated through a consultation activity where its extensive global user base comes together to collaborate on initiating, drafting and reviewing updates to the Framework. SFIA gives individuals and organisations a common language to define skill, abilities and expertise in a consistent way. It provides a common reference model in a two-dimensional framework consisting of skills on one axis and seven levels of responsibility on the other. It describes professional skills at various levels of competence. It also describes generic levels of responsibility, in terms of Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Business Skills, Knowledge and Security. 3.1.2. commentary SFIA is updated by its user community \u2013 primarily employers. It is directly relevant to industry needs. From version 7 (2018), the update process will be continual, and demand based \u2013 so, if users find a new skill has emerged, or is needed at a lower / higher level than is currently specified, it is possible to add to the framework. The current release of SFIA version 7 describes 102 skills. A typical job \u2013 or occupation \u2013 will usually be covered by two or three skills, usually at the same or similar levels. One key distinction between SFIA and the conjunctive lists of current DA standards is that the description of a skill gives exemplars that would demonstrate competence in that skill at a particular level. The exemplars are usually fairly generic, so that there is flexibility in how they might be interpreted in a particular environment. Furthermore, a given individual may not be performing all of the suggested activities \u2013 that does not mean they are not competent. SFIA is not a conjunctive checklist. The generic skills, defined by level rather than skill, cover many of the competencies required for accreditations such as FHEQ and QAA, as well as for the professional accreditation offered by BCS. New graduates would typically work at SFIA levels 2 or 3 (\u201cassist\u201d or \u201capply\u201d), but will usually have the underpinning knowledge to enable them to progress rapidly to higher levels. For graduates who have had relevant work experience, the starting level should certainly be level 3. Graduates\u2019 knowledge will also probably underpin at least some level 4 skill(s). Experience at SFIA Level 5 is the normal benchmark required to attain Chartered status, which one would expect normally to be achieved a few years after graduation. This level might be appropriate for post-experience Master\u2019s programmes. A final point \u2013 which could be very helpful \u2013 is that one of the activities in the current SFIA update is to map certifications, curricula and bodies of knowledge explicitly to the SFIA framework. https://www.sfia-online.org/en/reference-guide \u21a9","title":"High-level Proposal"},{"location":"standard/proposal/#3-high-level-proposal","text":"In order to address requirements (ii) and (iii), an appropriate model could be to use the SFIA framework as the abstraction framework, which will then support requirement (iv).

Rationale for a new accreditation standard 2.1 Aim The Institute of Coding aims to, \u201ccreate a new way to develop the digital skills you\u2019ll need at work and beyond.\u201d The purpose of IoC workstream 1.1 is to codesign with industry a new standard for \u201cdigital\u201d graduates. As the latest, post-Shadbolt, venture seeking to address the \u201cdigital skills gap\u201d, the focus is on digital skills for the workplace, rather than on knowledge and learning for their own sake. 2.2. Digital skills for the workplace The primary requirements of employers include \u2013 graduates must be billable (competent) graduates must be adaptable (underpinning knowledge for cognate skill areas) graduates must be effective problem solvers (which is fundamentally what university education is about) Note that these are the fundamental drivers for the IoC, not some nebulous concept of \u201cemployability\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cemployability\u201d needs to be at the heart of the IoC standard \u2013 it is not something that can be retro-fitted to an academic curriculum based on an encyclopaedic Body of Knowledge. 2.3. Bodies of Knowledge Academics and professional bodies have lots of experience of developing bodies of knowledge (BoKs). Typically, they draw upon (their own) existing courses, frameworks from external bodies such as Turing Institute or the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Significant reference points also include existing bodies of knowledge such as those published by ACM/IEEE. However, it should be noted that these tend to focus very much on academic content, rather than on practice. Furthermore, BoKs tend to aim to be universal, inclusive, exhaustive, complete, exhausting etc. With the possible (but unlikely) exception of really focussed BoKs like CyBok, addressing the whole of a BoK within a single degree programme would probably be extremely challenging. BoKs should be reference points, from which curricula are drawn, rather than templates for curricula. 2.4. Accreditation standards An accreditation standard is a statement of what all (accredited) graduates should achieve. For a degree, a standard must deliver the explicit outcomes included in both the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) outcomes statement and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) subject benchmark statement. In computing, the QAA SBS specifies a set of generic skills, and requires that the design of a curriculum should refer to the ACM BoK. There is no direct 1-1 mapping from a BoK to a realistic Standard; any resulting \u201cstandard\u201d would be a large, constraining, conjunctive \u201ctick list\u201d (like the Tech Partnership Degrees DTS degree apprenticeships.) If a BoK is used as a standard, then if a graduate fails to achieve any one item in the BoK, then they should fail their degree \u2013 which is neither realistic nor helpful, in the context of the IoC\u2019s aims. Rather than focus purely on (yet another) BoK, it is proposed that the focus be changed from knowledge to competence . 2.5. Competence Competence is more than being able to get correct answers to problems, or write correct code, or complete any other kind of university exercise. It\u2019s more than just practice, in a \u201cprotected\u201d university environment in which nobody can get hurt. Competence is about being able to apply knowledge and skills successfully in new environments, without the safety net of it \u201cjust being a university exercise\u201d Competence is about being able to \u201cfly solo\u201d, when it matters.

The IoC standard \u2013 principles SFIA is an industry focussed competence framework, maintained and updated by its users (primarily industry). We propose using SFIA as an abstraction layer \u2013 defining the standard in terms of competences in SFIA skills. Bodies of Knowledge will then be used to decide what must be in a curriculum to deliver (focussed) competence. The only place that most undergraduate students (without the benefit of a placement / internship etc.) will be able to demonstrate competence is likely to be in their final year (capstone) project. In that context, it is probable that there will be scope for the majority of students only to develop competence corresponding to one SFIA skill at (SFIA) Level 3 (\u201cApply\u201d).","title":"Rationale"},{"location":"standard/rationale/#2-rationale-for-a-new-accreditation-standard","text":"","title":"2.

The IoC standard \u2013 principles"},{"location":"standard/sfia-based/","text":"A SFIA-based standard An initial proposal for an IoC standard might be: A graduate from an IoC honours degree should have demonstrated competence in at least one skill at Level 3 , and should have the knowledge to underpin at least one SFIA skill at Level 4 , and at least 2 other relevant skills at level 3. They should be able to demonstrate all of the generic skills for Level 3 . For a graduate from a degree apprenticeship (where there is significant relevant work experience), this might be adapted to: A graduate from an IoC degree apprenticeship should be able to demonstrate competence in at least one SFIA skill at level 4, in one additional skill at level 3, and at have the knowledge to underpin least 2 more relevant skills at level 3. They should be able to demonstrate all of the generic skills for level 4. Note that the numbers of skills , and the definition of which ones would be relevant , are open to discussion. For example, it might be that the target for competence should be Level 4, rather than three, but that may be unrealistic in the absence of significant workbased experience (such as a placement year, or WB learning integrated into a Degree Apprenticeship). The \u201cgeneric skills\u201d for levels 3 are reproduced in Appendix 1, as are a selection of skill descriptors which might be relevant for data analytics and cyber-security curricula. This model could be readily adapted for Master\u2019s level degrees and apprenticeships, and also for sub-degree chunks (e.g, for theme 3). In addition, \u201clayering\u201d would be possible, so that, for example, level 1 of an IoC degree might be required to underpin skills at SFIA level 1 or 2. Alternatively, for Theme 3, and appropriate IoC accreditation might focus on a single SFIA skill at level 3 or 4, or perhaps three or four skills at level 2 (depending on the domain requirements). Commentary The skills listed in Appendix 1 are, at this stage, exemplars \u2013 there is no intention that this should be the prescriptive list for the data analytics standard to be developed by IoC. The principal advantages of adopting a standard based on SFIA include: Use of the SFIA framework provides an abstraction mechanism that can assure comparable standards across different curricula; The SFIA \u201cgeneric\u201d skills provide a core which seems to correspond both to IfA requirements, FHEQ and QAA benchmark statements and also to BCS CITP accreditation requirements. The abstraction mechanism allows those working on different curricula to select appropriate skills; SFIA is not prescriptive about how competence is developed - it allows providers to choose how to deliver that competence, and for competence to be developed by different providers within a single qualification; SFIA is widely recognised across industry \u2013 both in the UK and internationally. SFIA focusses on what it means to be competent \u2013 i.e., useful to an employer \u2013 rather than on curriculum input Given that the focus is on exemplars to demonstrate competence, so that different individuals (students/apprenticeships) may have strengths in different aspects of a skill, this approach avoids the \u201cconjunctive shopping list\u201d approach of other standards.
