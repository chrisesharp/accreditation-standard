# A SFIA-based standard

An initial proposal for an IoC standard might be:

> A graduate from an IoC honours degree should have demonstrated competence in **at least one** skill at **Level 3**, and should have the knowledge to underpin **at least one** SFIA skill at **Level 4**, and **at least 2** other relevant skills at level 3.
>
> They should be able to demonstrate **all** of the generic skills for **Level 3**.

For a graduate from a degree apprenticeship (where there is significant relevant work experience), this might be adapted to:

> A graduate from an IoC degree apprenticeship should be able to demonstrate    competence in at least one SFIA skill at level 4, in one additional skill    at level 3, and at have the knowledge to underpin least 2 more relevant skills at level 3.

They should be able to demonstrate all of the generic skills for level 4.

Note that the **numbers of skills**, and the definition of **which ones would be relevant**, are open to discussion.

For example, it might be that the target for competence should be Level 4, rather than three, but that may be unrealistic in the absence of significant workbased experience (such as a placement year, or WB learning integrated into a Degree Apprenticeship).

The “generic skills” for levels 3 are reproduced in Appendix 1, as are a selection of skill descriptors which might be relevant for data analytics and cyber-security curricula.

This model could be readily adapted for Master’s level degrees and apprenticeships, and also for sub-degree chunks (e.g, for theme 3).

In addition, “layering” would be possible, so that, for example, level 1 of an IoC degree might be required to underpin skills at SFIA level 1 or 2.  Alternatively, for Theme 3, and appropriate IoC accreditation might focus on a single SFIA skill at level 3 or 4, or perhaps three or four skills at level 2 (depending on the domain requirements).

## Commentary

The skills listed in Appendix 1 are, at this stage, exemplars – there is no intention that this should be the prescriptive list for the data analytics standard to be developed by IoC.

The principal advantages of adopting a standard based on SFIA include:

* Use of the SFIA framework provides an abstraction mechanism that can assure comparable standards across different curricula;

* The SFIA “generic” skills provide a core which seems to correspond both to IfA requirements, FHEQ and QAA benchmark statements and also to BCS CITP accreditation requirements.

* The abstraction mechanism allows those working on different curricula to select appropriate skills;

* SFIA is not prescriptive about how competence is developed - it allows providers to choose how to deliver that competence, and for competence to be developed by different providers within a single qualification;

* SFIA is widely recognised across industry – both in the UK and internationally.

* SFIA focusses on what it means to be competent – i.e., useful to an employer – rather than on curriculum input

* Given that the focus is on exemplars to demonstrate competence, so that different individuals (students/apprenticeships) may have strengths in different aspects of a skill, this approach avoids the “conjunctive shopping list” approach of other standards.

* BCS and IET are core partners in the SFIA Foundation.

## Final comments

The generic skills cover virtually all of the explicit requirements in the QAA subject benchmark statement (SBS), FHEQ and also those specified by IfA for apprenticeships.

Requiring underpinning knowledge for additional SFIA skills completes FHEQ/QAA requirements.

Crucially:

> Competence in 1 skill => billable
>
> Underpinning knowledge for additional skills => adaptability
>
> Generic skills => employability
>
> Non-specificity of standard => flexibility
