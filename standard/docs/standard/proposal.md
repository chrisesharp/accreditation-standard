# 3. High-level proposal

In order to address requirements (ii) and (iii), an appropriate model could be to use the SFIA framework as the abstraction framework, which will then support requirement (iv).

By working closely with BCS, we should ensure that the resulting standard will meet the accreditation requirements for CITP (requirement v).  This would allow the “occupation” for any degree apprenticeships to be “IT professional”, which is distinct from “digital and technology solutions professional” (i.(c)).

## 3.1. SFIA

### 3.1.1. (content from SFIA website)

SFIA[^1], the Skills Framework for the Information Age, describes skills required by professionals in roles involving information and communications technology.
Since [its formal inception in] 2000, SFIA has become the de facto global IT skills Framework, used in nearly 200 countries by organisations and individuals to characterise and manage their skills.  The SFIA Framework remains relevant and useful because it is simple and generic and is updated through a consultation activity where its extensive global user base comes together to collaborate on initiating, drafting and reviewing updates to the Framework.
SFIA gives individuals and organisations a common language to define skill, abilities and expertise in a consistent way.  It provides a common reference model in a two-dimensional framework consisting of skills on one axis and seven levels of responsibility on the other. It describes professional skills at various levels of competence. It also describes generic levels of responsibility, in terms of Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Business Skills, Knowledge and Security.

### 3.1.2. commentary

SFIA is updated by its user community – primarily employers.  It is directly relevant to industry needs.  From version 7 (2018), the update process will be continual, and demand based – so, if users find a new skill has emerged, or is needed at a lower / higher level than is currently specified, it is possible to add to the framework.

The current release of SFIA version 7 describes 102 skills.  A typical job – or occupation – will usually be covered by two or three skills, usually at the same or similar levels.

One key distinction between SFIA and the conjunctive lists of current DA standards is that the description of a skill gives exemplars that would demonstrate competence in that skill at a particular level.  The exemplars are usually fairly generic, so that there is flexibility in how they might be interpreted in a particular environment.  Furthermore, a given individual may not be performing all of the suggested activities – that does not mean they are not competent.  SFIA is ***not*** a conjunctive checklist.

The generic skills, defined by level rather than skill, cover many of the competencies required for accreditations such as FHEQ and QAA, as well as for the professional accreditation offered by BCS.
New graduates would typically work at SFIA levels 2 or 3 (“assist” or “apply”), but will usually have the underpinning knowledge to enable them to progress rapidly to higher levels.  For graduates who have had relevant work experience, the starting level should certainly be level 3.  Graduates’ knowledge will also probably underpin at least some level 4 skill(s).  

Experience at SFIA Level 5 is the normal benchmark required to attain Chartered status, which one would expect normally to be achieved a few years after graduation.  This level might be appropriate for post-experience Master’s programmes.

A final point – which could be very helpful – is that one of the activities in the current SFIA update is to map certifications, curricula and bodies of knowledge explicitly to the SFIA framework.
