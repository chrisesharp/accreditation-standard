# 2. Rationale for a new accreditation standard

## 2.1 Aim

The Institute of Coding aims to, “create a new way to develop the digital skills you’ll need at work and beyond.”

The purpose of IoC workstream 1.1 is to codesign with industry a new standard for “digital” graduates.

As the latest, post-Shadbolt, venture seeking to address the “digital skills gap”, the focus is on digital skills for the workplace, rather than on knowledge and learning for their own sake.

## 2.2. Digital skills for the workplace

The primary requirements of employers include –

- graduates must be billable (competent)
- graduates must be adaptable (underpinning knowledge for cognate skill areas)
- graduates must be effective problem solvers (which is fundamentally what university education is about)

Note that these are the fundamental drivers for the IoC, not some nebulous concept of “employability”.

Furthermore, “employability” needs to be at the heart of the IoC standard – it is not something that can be retro-fitted to an academic curriculum based on an encyclopaedic Body of Knowledge.

## 2.3. Bodies of Knowledge

Academics and professional bodies have lots of experience of developing bodies of knowledge (BoKs).

Typically, they draw upon (their own) existing courses, frameworks from external bodies such as Turing Institute or the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).  Significant reference points also include existing bodies of knowledge such as those published by ACM/IEEE.  However, it should be noted that these tend to focus very much on academic content, rather than on practice.

Furthermore, BoKs tend to aim to be universal, inclusive, exhaustive, complete, exhausting etc.  With the possible (but unlikely) exception of really focussed BoKs like CyBok, addressing the whole of a BoK within a single degree programme would probably be extremely challenging.  

BoKs should be reference points, from which curricula are drawn, rather than templates for curricula.

## 2.4. Accreditation standards

An accreditation standard is a statement of what all (accredited) graduates should achieve.

For a degree, a standard must deliver the explicit outcomes included in both the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) outcomes statement and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) subject benchmark statement.  

In computing, the QAA SBS specifies a set of generic skills, and requires that the design of a curriculum should refer to the ACM BoK.

There is no direct 1-1 mapping from a BoK to a realistic Standard; any resulting “standard” would be a large, constraining, conjunctive “tick list” (like the Tech Partnership Degrees DTS degree apprenticeships.)  If a BoK is used as a standard, then if a graduate fails to achieve any one item in the BoK, then they should fail their degree – which is neither realistic nor helpful, in the context of the IoC’s aims.  

Rather than focus purely on (yet another) BoK, it is proposed that the focus be changed from *knowledge* to **competence**.

## 2.5. Competence

Competence is more than being able to get correct answers to problems, or write correct code, or complete any other kind of university exercise.
It’s more than just practice, in a “protected” university environment in which nobody can get hurt.

Competence is about being able to apply knowledge and skills successfully in new environments, **without** the safety net of it “just being a university exercise”

Competence is about being able to “fly solo”, when it matters.

Competence is about what graduates can be let loose to do for clients...without close supervision.

## 2.6. The IoC standard – principles

SFIA is an industry focussed competence framework, maintained and updated by its users (primarily industry).
We propose using SFIA as an abstraction layer – defining the standard in terms of competences in SFIA skills.

Bodies of Knowledge will then be used to decide what must be in a curriculum to deliver (focussed) competence.

The only place that most undergraduate students (without the benefit of a placement / internship etc.) will be able to demonstrate competence is likely to be in their final year (capstone) project.  In that context, it is probable that there will be scope for the majority of students only to develop competence corresponding to **one** SFIA skill at (SFIA) Level 3 (“Apply”).
