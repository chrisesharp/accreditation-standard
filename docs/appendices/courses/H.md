# PROJ201: Group Project

**15 credits**

For this module, you will join a team of students from years two and three to complete some real-world tasks.  
Your role will be to build components for a project.  The third-year students will be responsible for coordinating and managing the project â€“ you will have that opportunity next year, so this is your chance to watch and learn, as well as gaining experience working in a team.
