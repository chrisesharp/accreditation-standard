> **15 credits**

## Block 1 Foundations of web technology

The first block covers the basic technologies on which the Web is founded. Aspects covered include: historic development of the Web; 'architecture' and basic client server architecture; protocols such as HTTP; content markup (HTML, CSS, XML) and issues of accessibility and usability; standards and standardisation organisations (W3C, Internet working group); and security (firewalls, HTTPS, certificates).

## Block 2 Web architectures

After examining the different approaches to web application architecture, Block 2 focuses on how the components of the client-server architecture can deliver dynamic content to web pages.
This block covers web application architectures, including cloud technology; server and client side components (web browsers, databases) and programming languages (JavaScript, PHP and SQL).

## Block 3 Mobile content

Block 3 examines the trend toward more portable content and content customisation and also explores mobile content and applications. It considers aspects such as Web 2, content manipulation and approaches to delivering content to mobile devices. You will also undertake the development of a simple mobile application.
