# CLIN102: Web Content Clinic

> **15 credits**

The web content clinic is part of the web development clinic run by the school.
As a first year member of the clinic, your role will be to populate and update websites that have been developed for clients.

You will not simply be typing ready-prepared material â€“ you will be creating the content from information provided by the client, ensuring that it is in a form that is appropriate for the intended audience.
As you work in the clinic, you will be gaining valuable experience, which you should log in your e-portfolio.
