# PROJ301: Group Project

> **15 credits**

You will gain experience in multiple aspects of software project management, including requirements reviews, component integration and testing, Your focus will be on the execution of the overall project, rather than on development of individual components.  However, you will also have the opportunity to contribute to the project specification, approach and priorities.

In this module, you will be leading and managing, jointly with one or two other third year students, a group of year 2 students to deliver an industry-sponsored project.

You will share the responsibility to manage the team's use of industry-standard cide repositiry, GitHub, and to ensure that it supports collaborative devolopment.  Groups who can not demonstrate effective use of GitHub are likely to score poorly on this module.

You will also share responsibility for liaising with the module leader, and with your group's industrial mentor.

The experience you gain should be recorded in your professional portfolio: it will count towards the experience you require for a "competency" badge.
