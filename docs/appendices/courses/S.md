# RQMS301: Requirements Management

**15 credits**

Comparing traditional approaches with agile processes and practices, you will learn about well-known software development processes, their phases, activities and techniques. This will help you to develop a critical understanding of the diversity of contexts of organisations, problems, and development teams, which will allow you to use your own judgment in a real situation.

By studying this module you will:

* be able to understand the business domain for a problem requiring a software solution or a change to an existing solution
* acquire the tools and knowledge to analyse and design such a solution or change
* understand how any chosen software architecture will impact on the satisfaction of all users requirements and expectations
* be able to apply and reuse design expertise from a set of design patterns
* develop the skills for testing outputs of all activities throughout the development process.

You will be equipped to apply your knowledge to the design of a wide range of software systems; from small systems in a single organisation (which still need to interact with a range of other services online) to those working in large-scale distributed environments based on coalitions of systems.
